EHRServer is the first open source Clinical Data Management and Sharing Platform, compliant with the [openEHR standard](https://specifications.openehr.org/). Use it as a:

  * Primary clinical data repository for web and mobile clinical apps.
  * Secondary repository for backup or analysis.
  * Centralized repository to share clinical information between many systems.
  * Fast prototyping of new health related apps, removing the need of creating the clinical repo yourself.
  * Main or proxy repository for wearable and other monitoring-based clinical data.
  * Standardized aggregation repository as a data source for ETL to datawarehouses and analytics tools.
  * Research and training clinical data repository.
  * Backend for Clinical Decision Support tools (e.g. rule engines)


EHRServer was designer for developers by developers. You don't need to be an openEHR guru to use it. Easy to install, use, manage and integrate.

## Quick architecture reference

  * REST API provides services to integrate the EHRServer to your systems and apps ([documentation](https://cloudehrserver.com/learn)).
  * Web Console provides a user interfaces for administrators of the EHRServer (check the screenshots above).
  * Query Builder is the component in charge of creating, managing and executing queries over openEHR data stored in the EHRServer.
  * SNOMED Query is a component in charge of processing the terminologic constraints in queries that contain SNOMED CT Expressions. This component is part of the [SNQUERY](https://snquery.veratech.es/) tool developed by [VeraTech](https://www.veratech.es/)
  * EHR Base is where data is managed, indexed, versioned and stored.
